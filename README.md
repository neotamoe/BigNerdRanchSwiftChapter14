# Big Nerd Ranch Swift - Chapter 14

#### Learning Highlights
* enumerations (or enums) allow you to create instances that are one of a defined list of cases
* enums begin with capital letters by convention and are camelCased
* variables, functions and enum cases begin with lowercase letter and are camelCased if needed
* swift enums don't have an underlying integer type, but you can use that same behavior (as in C or C++) by using a raw value
* you can specify raw values for String type, but don't have to...if you don't specify a raw value, swift will use the name of the case itself.
* associated values allows you to attach data to instances of an enumeration and different cases can have different types of associated values

#### Challenges
Bronze and Silver: both completed

#### Tech Used
* Swift 3
